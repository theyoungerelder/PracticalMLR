#' #1. Importing the Data
#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Load the retail data into a sparse matrix (Note the use of 'read.transactions' for this dataset).
groceries <- read.transactions("groceries.csv", sep = ",")

#----------------------------------------------------------------
#' #2. Explore and Prepare the Data
#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Let's take a look at the summary stats for the dataset.
summary(groceries)

# Q:What does the density value mean?

# Q:What do the other summary statistics tell us?

# Let's take a look at the first five transactions.
inspect(groceries[1:5])

# Using the itemFrequency() function, we can create a tibble of the items and their support.
library(tidyverse)
groceries_frequency <-
  tibble(
    Items = names(itemFrequency(groceries)),
    Frequency = itemFrequency(groceries)
  )

# Get summary stats for the support values.
groceries_frequency %>%
  select(Frequency) %>%
  summary()

# Q: What are the 10 most frequently bought items at this store?
groceries_frequency %>%
  arrange(desc(Frequency)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

#----------------------------------------------------------------
#' #3. "Train" the Model
#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Let's say we decide to include items that were purchased on average at least 5 times a day.
# Given that our data is for 30 days, we would need to set our support threshold at 0.015 -> ((5*30)/9835).
# We set our cofidence threshold to 0.25 and our minimum rule length to 2.

            support = 0.015,
